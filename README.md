# Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of data projects intended for continuous learning.

# Data Science Projects
## Machine Learning (Python)
- [Predicting Credit Card Application Approvals](https://github.com/WilliamBaxter417/Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Credit%20Card%20Approval): Developed machine learning models in Python to predict credit card application approvals. Implemented logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours and random forest algorithms. Explored data processing, data integrity, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics.
- [Loan Repayment Prediction using Feature Selection](https://github.com/WilliamBaxter417/Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Predicting%20Loan%20Repayments): Applying machine learning and statistical techniques in Python to identify key features driving loan defaults. Exploring feature selection, feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.

## Reporting & Database Management (SQL)
- [Managing Customer & Product Data](https://github.com/WilliamBaxter417/Portfolio/tree/main/Reporting%20%26%20Database%20Management): Created a relational cloud database back-end to store and query synthetic customer and sales data of a sample e-commerce company using the Microsoft Azure framework. Explored schemas, queries, data analytics and dashboards.

## Dynamic Programming and Algorithm Design (Python)
- [Performance Analysis of the Frequency-Hopped Code Selection Scheme](https://github.com/WilliamBaxter417/Portfolio/tree/main/Dynamic%20Programming%20%26%20Algorithm%20Design): Implementation of the Frequency-Hopped Code Selection (FHCS) scheme for Dual-Function Radar Communications (DFRC) technologies which was the subject of my PhD thesis. Showcases proficiency with dynamic programming and algorithm design with Python.
